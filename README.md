## Introduction 

Image analysis is one of my favourite topics in the Data Science program from Brainstation. 
The power of image analysis is able to extract information from an image and assign importance 
to various aspects in the image and be able differentiate one from the others. For example, 
the machine is able to differentiate between cats and dogs. This opens up toons of applications 
like my capstone project. The title of my project is Face Recognition and Emotion Detection. 
The goal behind this project is to demonstrate and show how data can take care of our health and 
secure our life by using the data science tools K-nearest neighborsâ€™ algorithm, Principal component analysis 
and Neural Network. 


## Tools and Packages that I used for this project:

#### Record Tools
* OpenCV

#### Modeling/Machine Learning
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow/ Keras
* Numpy
* Pandas

#### Data visualization:
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
